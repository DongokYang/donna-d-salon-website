She has many years of experience and very trustworthy. I highly recommend her! I'd like to thank Donwin as well. He's really nice and I love the scalp massage. He's such a pro! lol I forgot the name of her daughter who did the haircut to my husband. She really did a great job on his hair too. I can say that the price is right! because we're so happy with the service and experience. The place is very welcoming and comfortable too. Thanks again to Donna and her team!! ‚ù§"

He personally let me in and proceeded with the usual COVID screening measures and took my temp. Masks were provincially mandatory when I went. Donwin began with cleaning and conditioning my hair and then discussed my preferences with the look I was going for. I showed him a picture of my desired look, and he took my ad hoc suggestions in stride. He was professional, verbal about his actions, and personable with conversation. He didn't usually work on beards but I asked him to clean it up for me and he did with no issues or fuss. Donna was great with consultative suggestions with various aspects of the beard as well. Donwin made it happen with no problems. Pictures attached from 3 times I went, 2 pics per time. Thanks, Donwin!"

Being somebody who isn't experienced or used to maintaining hair, Dana took the time to answer my questions, explain certain things and recommend some products for my new hair! If you're looking for a new stylist or salon, this is the place to go. Definitely worth your time and money! Already looking forward to my next visit."
